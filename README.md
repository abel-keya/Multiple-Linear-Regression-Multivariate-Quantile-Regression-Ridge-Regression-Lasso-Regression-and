# Multiple Linear Regression ,Multivariate Quantile Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression and Elastic Net Regression
**Problem statement:**  Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience. You have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale prices. 

The project code implements multivariate linear regression techniques:
* Multiple Linear Regression 
* Multivariate Quantile Regression
* Ridge Regression 
* Lasso Regression 
* Elastic Net Regression

An interrogation of the characteristics of the models on the coefficients is performed.The  performance of Each models is obtained in terms of MSE is obtained,
The best performing model is optimized in the problem solution
